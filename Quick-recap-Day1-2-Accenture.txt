Quick recap 

- Introduction part
   - Linux vs Enterprise Linux 
   - What is OS and why used (OS types - Client, Server)
   - Server (RHEL - Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server - RHEL 8).
   - As of now (RHEL6/7/8 -in production)
     NOte: RHEL6 as of now under extended support.

- Basic commands and utilities 
   - Basic commands.
      whoami, pwd, ls, which, cd , cd .. (cd ../..), cd - , mkdir, rm, rmdir, tree, 
   - Concepts of commands 
     "COmmand Options Argument" 
	  cp -r dir1 dir2 
	  command - It's utility to perform any action.
	   NOte: Every command having manual pages and help option.
	   man command_name (man 1 command_type_1 or man 8 command_type_2)
	   command_type_1 - /bin or /usr/bin 
	   command_type_2 - /sbin or /usr/sbin 
	   
	   command --help 
	   
	   Option - Which modify the behaviour of the command.
	    NOte: All option details can be get via manual pages.
		
	   Argument - Data required to execuite coammnds.
	   NOte: All option details can be get via manual pages.
	   
	- Read Manual pages 
	   man 1 cp or man 8 useradd or man 5 shadow 
	   
	   /string  (this is for search for given string).
	   TYpe "n" for next search 
	   Type "N" for Previous seach 
	   Type "G" to reach to last line of the page.
	   Type "g" to reach the top line of the manual page.
	   Type "q" for quit 
	   
	 - Directory and file creations(operations onf it).
	  - mkdir  - TO create dir  
	  - touch  - To create emply file 
	  - vim    - Editor to create file with some contents.
	    vim file_name 
		PRESS key "i" - Insert mode (ONly in insert mode you can write/update the file).
		Type your contents 
		Again type your contents 
		...
		...
		Press "Ese" key to lock the screen (it's lock mode).
		Press ":wq"   - Recommended one
		Press ":wq!"  - This is forcefully saved and closed.
	   
	   - cat - to see the contents of file 
	   - grep - to get the perticular line (as per given string).
Take   - tail, head,wc, STDIO, STDIN, STERR, redirector (>, >>, 2> or &> and |). 


      - Absolute abd relative path 
	  - Linux hierarchy tree (default directories "/"). 
	  - vimtutor 
      
- User management 
       - Users
       - Type of users (Admin user - root, Normal user - john, user1, system user).
       - Groups 
       - Type of groups (Primary Group, 2ndry Group).
	     NOte: 
		  Primary group info (/etc/passwd)
		  2ndry group info  - /etc/group 
		  
	   - Password (/etc/shadow)
	   - HOme directory & mail dir 
	       HOme dir  - /home/user_name 
		   Mail file - /var/spool/mail/username 
		   
	   - commands (user management commands).
	      - useradd 
		  - userdel 
		  - usermod 
		  - groupadd
		  - groupmod 
		  - groupdel 
		  - passwd (echo redhat | passwd --stdin user_name).
		  - chmod (chmod 755 file/dir - 7 means = read(4)+write(2)+execute(1), 7 for owner, next 5 for groupowner, last 5 for other).
		  - chown ( chown user:groupowner file/dir , chmod root:unixadm /ORG, only root can change the ownership).
		    ownership can be group or direct owner.
	      - umask  - It provide default directories/files permission.
          - chage 
		  
		  
       - Important files w.r.t User management.
        /etc/passwd   (7 fields, each are seprated by ":")
   		/etc/group    (4 fields)
		/etc/shadow   (9 fields)
		/etc/login.def (This file refered when we execute user management commands. 
       
	    Note: To know more about above files, please use manual 5th page eg: (man 5 passwd).
		
	   - SUID, SGID, StickyBit 
	   - SUID explained - When SUID setup on any executable file then as per the permission and ownership (explained below).
	      a) When SUID setup on any executable file.
		      - HOw to set SUID - chmod 4<default-premission-continue> file_name 
			    Example: ls -l /usr/bin/passwd 
				
				-rwxr-xr-x   root root <SOME-info> /usr/bin/passwd 
				
				Owner - root 
				Group-Owner - root 
				
				  default-premission on this file is - 755 (owner permission=r+w+x, group=r+x, other=r+x)
                 It mean anyone can execute this file (/usr/bin/passwd)
				 
				 chmod 4755 /usr/bin/passwd
			  - SUID mean - when anyone execute mentioned file (/usr/bin/passwd) then it will execute as owner of this file.
			     Everyone execuite mentioned file as root user.
			  
		   b) What "/usr/bin/passwd" file will do ?
			    It change the password and update in "/etc/shadow" file.
				Even we don't have permission on "/etc/shadow - 000 ) but after that also any user able to update password to this file using "/usr/bin/passwd").
			  
        - SGID explained - When SGID setup on any executable dir then as per the permission and ownership (explained below).
	      a) When SGID setup on any directory.
		      HOw to set SGID - chmod 2<default-premission-continue> file_name 
			    Example: ls -l /ORG 
				
				drwxrwx---  root unixadm <SOME-info> /ORG  
				
				Owner - root 
				Group-Owner - unixadm 
				
				  default-premission on this file is - 770 (owner permission=r+w+x, group=r+w+x, other=---)
                 It mean only root and users belongs to "unixadm" group can access "/ORG" - Normal permission (770)
				 
				 chmod 2770 /ORG 
				 ls -ld /ORG 
				 drwxrws---  root unixadm /ORG 
				 
				 When SUID setup on "/ORG" directory.
				 Now if any file or directory created under "/ORG", it will automatically get same group ownership what you can set on "/ORG" 
				 
				 
				 
 		- StickyBit:-
		    It mean when stickybit setup then no one can delete the files/dir of others (even having full permission).
			- ONly root and owner of the file/dir can delete the file.
			
			 chmod 1777 /tmp_my 
			 ls -ld /tmp_my 
			 drwxrwxrwt   root root /tmp_my 
			
=================================================================================================================
Q1 ) Create file with below line

 This is my 1st day 
 This is my 2nd day 
 continue till 10th day 
 
Q2 ) Reeplac "This" to "THIS"

Q3) Copy 17-23 line from file (/etc/passwd) to file_q3.txt using redirectors (>,tail, head ).

Q4) output of  file "file_q3.txt" to file5.txt (all output in upper case).

==============================================
Soft Link:-

mkdir work 
cd work 
pwd
cp -r /etc/passwd .
ls -l
mkdir data 
mv passwd data/
tree 
ln -s data/passwd sl_passwd
ls -l 
     sl_passwd --> data/passwd 


So anythings on any file (sl_passwd or data/passwd), both file have same contents all the time.

rm -rf data/passwd 


Then your soft link will be called dead link.


With softlink - Both file have different Inode Number.

ls -li /file_name - absolute path.

--------
Hard link 
ln source hardlink 
ln /data_source link

===================
mkdir work 
compress "/etc" folger -tar, bunZup, gunzip 
 and verify it


- Specific name of file (Login as root)
  find / -name passwd 
  
- File which is having ownership u1 and group ownership "unixteam"
==========================
Process Management:- 
 What is process ?  - Program under execution called process.
  
  Execute the program, it become process.
 What is program ?
   "Set of instructions" why to perform some task.
   
   /bin or /usr/bin    - Program not required root access 
   /sbin or /usr/sbin  - Programs required root previlege 

  commands are programs please in (/sbin or /bin - /usr/bin or /usr/sbin).
  All programs under above dir having executable permission (other having executable access).
  
  Program under execution become process and evry process having major components.
  PID - Process ID 
  PPID - Parent Process ID.
  UID or one or more GID.    (Every PID associated with one UID)
  UID = User ID 
  GID = Group ID 

  ps -aef     - All process 
  ps -eo pcpu,pid,ppid,stat,comm | head -1 ; ps -eo pcpu,pid,ppid,stat,comm |sort -nr | head -5
  ps -eo pcpu,pid,ppid,stat,comm | head -1 ; ps -eo pcpu,pid,ppid,stat,comm |sort -nr | head -10
  
  ps -eo pmem,pid,ppid,stat,comm | head -1 ; ps -eo pmem,pid,ppid,stat,comm |sort -nr | head -5
  ps -eo pmem,pid,ppid,stat,comm | head -1 ; ps -eo pmem,pid,ppid,stat,comm |sort -nr | head -10
  
  
=============== 
Process Priority 
nice 
renice 

Minimum the number max the priority.
-20 to +19 

reset the process priority 
renice -n -19 -p PID 34567

nice -n -19 ./script.sh

 kill -l 
 kill -19 PID 
 
 
 =========================================
 Package Management:-
 
 package or software - 
 
 When install package/software then only we can use the service 
 
 RPM  - rpm file must be available (locally)
 YUM  - Repo needed 
 
 Steps to configure YUM.
 
 1) df -THP  (RHEL8.2 ISO mounted on this system - iso9960).
   MOunted on /run/media/rsp/RHEL8.2-BaseOS 
   
    # df -THP 
   
 2) mkdir -p /var/www/html/repo
    Note: Creating this folder to copy all the DVD/ISO contents to "/var/www/html/repo"
	
	
	# mkdir -p /var/www/html/repo
	
 3) Now access packages location and copy all contents 
    
	# cd /run/media/rsp/<Press-TAB>
	# pwd
	# ls 
	# cp -rv * /var/www/html/repo/
	
	Below steps for verification.
	
	# ls -l /var/www/html/repo/BaseOS 
	# ls -l /var/www/html/repo/AppStream 
	
	NOte: Once copy complated then
	
 4) Create local repos 1st 
 
  # cd /etc/yum.repos.d/

	vim local.repo 
	[local_repo_BaseOS]
	name= Local RHEL8.2 repo 
	baseurl = file:///var/www/html/repo/BaseOS 
	gpgcheck = 0 
	enabled = 1
	
   [local_repo_AppStream]
	name= Local RHEL8.2 repo 
	baseurl = file:///var/www/html/repo/AppStream
	gpgcheck = 0 
	enabled = 1
	
	:wq

    NOte: Do ls (/etc/yum.repos.d/) only see local.repo file (rest all move to /tmp)
    Eg: redhat.repo , mv redhat.repo /tmp )	
	
5) yum clean all ; yum repolist 

6) yum install httpd 

7) systemctl start httpd	
	
 ======================
 package module streams
 - BaseOS    (baseurl)
 - AppSteam  (baseurl)
 
  MOdule Stream
 
 yum module list 
 yum module list perl 
 yum module info perl 
 yum module list --profile perl:5.24 
 yum module install perl

 Setup Static IP and Dynamic IP:- 
  What is IP address ?
   32 bits logical address (dot decimal format)
    1-127     - Class A IP range 
	128-191   - Class B 
	192-223    - Class C
	======================
	224-239    - Class D  
	240-255    - Class E 
  
  # ifconfig (But this interface almost decomm - it's recommeneded to use ip command)
  # ip add show 
  
  Static IP - IP address setup Manually (specific IP set)
  Dynamic IP - (IP address provided by DHCP)
  
  
  Setup the ip Address 
  Current IP address - 172.20.0.152/24  (CIDR is 24 (8+8+8+0) = 255.255.255.0)
   
   172.20.0.152/24
    172.20.0.0    - Network Address (Can not be assigned to any host).
	172.20.0.1    - 1st IP aggress
	172.20.0.2    - 2nd IP address 
	..
	..
	..
	172.20.0.254  - Last IP address 
	172.20.0.255  - BC address  (Can not be assigned to any host).
	
    No of hosts: 2^8 -2 = 256 - 2 
	            = 254 
  
  New IP need to setup. 
  IP address  : 172.20.0.152
  Subnet Mask : 24 
  Gateway     : 172.20.0.1 
  DNS or nameserver - 172.20.0.1
  
  1) Show your system connection 
    nmcli connection show  (use lab here )
	nmcli device show 
	
  2) Setup new connection 
   nmcli connection add con-name accenture-network01 autoconnect yes ifname ens32 type ethernet 
   nmcli connection show 
   
  3) Connection modified.

   nmcli connection modify accentrure-network01 ipv4.address 172.20.0.152/24 ipv4.gateway 172.20.0.1 ipv4.dns 172.20.0.1 ipv4.dns-search lab.example.com method none 

  4) Connection reload
    nmcli connection reload accentrure-network01
	
  5) Backend work 
    cat /etc/sysconfig/scripts-network/ifcfg-accenture-network01 
	
	If static not working (update in the file "ifcfg-accenture-network01")
	DHCP=none 
	
	reboot your machine once (reboot actually not required as per production, but we are trying to make it).
	
	
	nmcli connection add con-name accenture-network-dhcp ifname eth0 autoconnect yes

		 add below instruction 
		 
		 rd.break console=tty1 
		 
		 then 
		 
		 press "Ctrl + x key) - to boot the system as per your provided input.
		 
	Step 3) Once you have terminal 
	   # chroot /sysroot 
	   # mount -o remount,rw /
	   # passwd root or ( echo passwd | passwd --stdin root )
	   # touch /.autorelabel 
	   # exit 
	   # exit
	   
	   and your machine might take 1,2,3 mins time to reload the SELinux policies, once all policies loaded then again it might reboot your system.
	   once system up and verify your changes.

	# who -r 
	# systemctl set-default multi-user.target   (runlevel -3 - Network + CLI)

	# systemctl set-default graphical.target    (runlevel -5 - Network + GUI --> CLI )
	# systemctl reboot
	
	
	================================
	Copying data remotely 
	using scp and rsync
	Note: 
	- rsync is recommeneded 
	- Both using ssh connection (it mean if sshd service not running, scp and rsync will not work to that server).
	Suppose 
	server name - servera 
	User name   - root 
	Source      - /data01 
	
	Server name - serverb 
	User name   - admin
	destination - /var/data01 
	
	
	# whomai 
	root 
	# hostname 
	servera 
	
	# scp -r /data01 admin@serverb:/var/data01
    It will ask for user "admin" password.
    and user admin must be having (read & Write & Execute ) permission on directory "/var/data01"


    # rsync -avz /data01 admin@serverb:/var/data01	
	It will ask for user "admin" password.
    and user admin must be having (read & Write & Execute ) permission on directory "/var/data01"
	
	NOte: Is you have passwordless auth, then no password required.
	
	===========================================
	Configure local storage
	# lsblk 
	# lsblk -fp 
	# lsblk /dev/sdc 
	
	Disk used for FS 
	
	# mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdc 
	# blkid /dev/sdc
	# mount /dev/sdc /data01 
	This is call temp mount.
	
	# reboot (after reboot MP will work.

	======================================
	Disk partitions
	- As per MBR - we can create max 4 primary partition 
	- As per MBR - We cab create max 1-3 primary partitions and 1 extended partition, under extended partition we can create 
	logical partition.
	
	- Logical partion can not be created until extended partition not ready (logical partition take size from extended partition).
	Suppose you have given 10Gb size to extended partition then only 10Gb can be alocated to logical partition.
	
	
	# lsblk 
	# lsblk -ft 
	# parted /dev/sdb 
	# mklabel 
	# msdos 
	# mkpart 
	
	or 
	# parted /dev/sdb mklabel msdos  (1st command to create partition).
	# parted /dev/sdb 
	mkpart 
	  --> Primary/Extended : Primary
	  --> File System type : ext4 
	  start? 2048s
	  end?   1001MB 
	  quit 
	  
	# parted /dev/sdb print

	===========================
	Now logical VOlume Manager (LVM)  (Primary, extended and under extended we have logical partition)
	
	Step 1) 
	 
	 - Linux partitions creation using parted 
	 
	 
	# parted /dev/sdb mklabel msdos  (1st command to create partition).
	
	If it's not 1st time then start from below.
	N number of partition can be created.
	
	# parted /dev/sdb 
	mkpart 
	  --> Primary/Extended : Primary
	  --> File System type : ext4 
	  start? 2048s
	  end?   1001MB 
	  quit 
	  
	# parted /dev/sdb print 
	# udevadm settle  (It will update to kernel, regarding partition table).


    Suppose 3 partition created.
	 
	Step 2) 
	  - Create physical volume 
	   pvcreate /dev/sdb2 /dev/sdb3 /dev/sdb4 
	   pvs
	   pvscan 
	   pvdisplay

	
	Step 3) 
	  - Create Volume Group 
	  
	  # vgcreate -s 4M vgname /dev/sdb2 /dev/sdb3 /dev/sdb4 
	  # vgscan 
	  # vgs
	  # vgdisplay 
	  
	  Support VG size is = No of PE 740 * PE side (4M) 
	     VG size = 740 * 4 MB 
		 
	  
	Step 4) 
	  - Create Logical Volume manager 
	
	lvcreate -l no_of_PE -n LVM_name vgname 
	lvs
	lvscan 
	lvdisplay 
	
	
	Step 5) 
	  - Create File System on LVM.
	  
	LVM path /dev/vgname/lvname 
                           
						   
     mkfs -t ext3  	/dev/vgname/lvname 
	 
	 blkid /dev/vgname/lvname 
	 
	 UUID 
	 
	 vim /etc/fstab 
	 
	 Update the entry 
	 
	 # mount -a 
	 # df -THP 
	 ======================================
	 SWAP partion 
	 

	Step 1) 
	 
	 - Linux partitions creation using parted 
	 
	 
	# parted /dev/sdb mklabel msdos  (1st command to create partition).
	
	If it's not 1st time then start from below.
	N number of partition can be created.
	
	# parted /dev/sdb 
	mkpart 
	  --> Primary/Extended : Primary
	  --> File System type : ext4 
	  start? 2048s
	  end?   1001MB 
	  quit 
	  
	# parted /dev/sdb print 
	# udevadm settle  (It will update to kernel, regarding partition table).


    # mkswap /dev/sdb6 
    # blkid /dev/sdb6
    vim update in /etc/fstab 
     
    UUID   swap swap defaults 0 0 

    # mount -a 
    # swapon -s 
    # free -m -t 
    # swapon -a 
    # swapon -s 
    # free -m -t 
=============================================================================

   File Sharing – NFS and SAMBA
   
   - NFS used for file sharing between Linux/UNIX based OS 
    Step 1) INstall NFS packages (nfs-server)
	Step 2) mkdir /data01 
	       vim /etc/export
		   /data01   *(rw)
		   
		  $ export -fs 
	Step 3) systemctl start nfs-server 
	        systemctl enable nfs-server 
	Step 4) Add NFS port to firewalld 
	
   
   - Samba  used of file sharing service between Window and Linux/Unix 
     Samba server building on Linux Machine.
